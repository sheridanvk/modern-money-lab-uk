        title: The Anti-Austerity Conference
        subtitle: '12-13 September 2025, Bristol'
        text: >
          For too long the solutions to our cost-of-living and environmental
          crises have been held back by a misunderstanding of the freedom and
          capacity the UK government has to fund these solutions.


          Join us in Bristol to learn powerful, real, economic knowledge that
          blows traditional thinking apart and allows social and environmental
          goals to take centre stage. No prior knowledge is needed, this event
          is highly accessible and open to all.

          This one-day workshop will empower participants to counter the common
          narrative that significant public interest investment is unaffordable
          or must be paid for by implementing austerity measures, with a focus
          on the Eurozone. You will come away with a true understanding of how
          governments spend money and what is possible.
