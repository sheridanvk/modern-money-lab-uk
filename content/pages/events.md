        title: The Anti-Austerity Conference
        subtitle: '12-13 September 2025, Bristol'
        text: >
          This conference will debunk money myths to counter the common
          narrative that significant public interest investment is unaffordable
          or must be paid for by implementing austerity measures. Whether for
          healthcare, employment, climate action or housing, you will come away
          with a true understanding of how our government spends money, which is
          constrained only by available resources and environmental
          considerations.
