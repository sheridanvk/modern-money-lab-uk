          This workshop will empower participants to counter the common
          narrative that significant public interest investment is unaffordable
          or must be paid for by implementing austerity measures. Whether for
          healthcare, education, climate action, or whatever is needed, you will
          come away with a true understanding of how governments spend money and
          what is possible.
